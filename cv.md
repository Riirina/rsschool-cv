# About me
I am 22 year old. My hometown is St.Petersburg. Despite of the fact that I am not very good at Maths, I am always intrested in programming. Counting the whole time of my life, I can say with a certain that I am not in a number of people, who prefer lying on the bed and doing nothing. Creativity and achivment of goals - are my life credo. Once a day I came up with the idea to create my own site, and from that moment, I do my best for recreating my thougths in projects.
# Code
'use strict';
                let question = prompt('What is an official name of JS?','');
                    if (question == 'ECMAScript') {
                        alert('You are right!');
                            }else {
                        alert('Do not know? ECMAScript!');
                    }
